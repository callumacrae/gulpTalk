# Demo from my talk on Gulp

These are the files I used yesterday in my talk on Gulp.

To install, make sure you have Gulp 4 installed globally:

```
$ npm install -g gulpjs/gulp-cli#4.0
```

Then install the dependencies locally:

```
$ npm install
```

Then take a look at the gulpfile, and run `gulp` to use!
